       <h2><strong>ADDERALL HOME: THE PLACE TO GET HOOKED</strong></h2>
<p>Adderall home: We may not have had a choice. We either got on the drug or risked ourselves to never become a functioning part of society. </p>
<p>Our trouble was concentration; we just couldn&rsquo;t do it. Our dysfunction was how to function socially. Our focus was nowhere near in focus.</p>
<p>Adderall was prescribed, and we had no say in the matter. Not that we would at such a young age in which we could take care of ourselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>OUR PARENTS KNEW NO BETTER</strong></h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t blame them. Honestly, many people they knew no better. Being diagnosed for ADHD, then later being placed on Adderall, all Mom and Dad cared about was us getting better.</p>
<p>We were to be better focused, more aware, pointed, concentrated on what we needed to concentrated.</p>
<p>And the hoped-for result: Higher school marks, sharper intellect, stronger social skills, better friends – please let our kid have better friends, and not just acquaintances who choose to make fun of our kid&rsquo;s ADHD.</p>
<p>And for a good while, the drug worked. It really did.</p>
<p>Everything stayed together without the slightest hint that all the way into our adulthood, we were becoming Adderall addicts.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h2><strong>ADDERALL HOME: THE PLACE NOT TO GET HEALED</strong></h2>
<p>As safe as innocuous as your child home might seem to you, it can be a bit difficult to think it was here, inside these strong walls and ceiling, that something still got inside under the auspices of helping to now hopelessly getting you addicted.</p>
<p>You see, Adderall is a stimulant. It has amphetamine properties to its chemical makeup. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s made you be able to focus all this time, to now, where you realize to continue your focus, you need to continue using the drug, which is called dependency.<br>
  Adderall home: the place not to get healed from your Adderall addiction. Adderall dependency and subsequent withdrawals can be very dangerous. At this point, your best option is to seek out a licensed rehabilitation facility staffed with licensed clinical workers. They can monitor your recovery, making sure you do so in the safest way possible, that can also guarantee your eventual sobriety.<br>
